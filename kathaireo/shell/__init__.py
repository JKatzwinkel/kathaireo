"""\
The contents of the :mod:`.shell` package implement a simple
interactive command-line shell for operating on RDF resources.

Main concern of this package is assisting the user's input, e.g.
by providing autocompletion and feedback like error messages.
Nonetheless, the :mod:`.shell` package serves merely as an interface
between user and the actual `kathaireo` functionality, which is
realized in the :mod:`.rdf` and :mod:`.commands` packages. In fact, the
interactive shell is mainly intended to just take care of useful
input/output features. Everything beyond that is delegated
elsewhere.

The more interesting functions of the package's root
module is :func:`run`.
By calling :func:`run`, an
interactive shell is started which passes user input to the
:mod:`.commands` package for execution. When called as a script,
this module will automatically start a shell.
